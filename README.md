# Atolla â€“ Open Source Lighting

Atolla is an open hardware project for makers to build exciting network
programmable lighting projects in little time.

It consists of three parts:
* Documentation and implementation of a protocol to communicate with Atolla devices,
* firmware for the 2$ WiFi-enabled microprocessor ESP8266,
* instructions on how to build and configure the hardware that hosts the firmware.

## Atolla Protocol
[`protocol/doc/Atolla Protocol.md`](https://github.com/krachzack/atolla/blob/develop/protocol/doc/Atolla%20Protocol.md) provides a desription of the implemented
protocol.

## Building an Atolla-compatible device
The `hardware` folder contains currently nothing but in the future it will
contain instructions, maybe also production-ready PCB-layouts, for the building
of hardware that the firmware in `firmware` runs on.
